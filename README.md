# Project GA Restaurants (Food Delivery)

Hello, this is a project to practice a little on what was taught in the General Assembly course.

In this project it is possible to log in with your Google account and the account will be created automatically, you need to register the delivery address to place an order by clicking on your profile photo and then on the Address tab.

The project is consuming the Yelp API to get data of restaurants close to the user's location, this location is saved for 2 days in cookies. On the main page it is possible to click on a restaurant to view a product page, this page always has the same items as the API does not return menu data. You can also check the my orders page, which contains the user's entire order history.

# Future ideas:

游릭 Implement the shopping cart

游릭 Use of some paid API that provides both restaurant information and the menu

游릭 Payment methods

游릭 Change location to find restaurants in other cities or countries

游릭 Use of React framework
